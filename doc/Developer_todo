1.  Implement the SASA calc with a sphere of vdW R + 1.4 A out from every atom to vdW R 3.0 A.
  This includes 
  0-1. Compile dx, dy, dz, and r as 1749 * 1749 matrices <- a separate kernel.
  1-1. Get vdW radii for each atom.
  1-2. Equal volume partition of each sphere (center at atom, r = 3.0 A + vdW radius)
       This can be done by having a function returning N raster points in the sphere
  2-1. For each center atom (block) and for every test atom (thread), calculate distance between the atoms. 
  2-2. If any of these conditions are met, skip that entire test atom:
    2-2-1. dx or dy or dz > 6.0 + vdW radius of center atom + vdW radius of test atom.
    2-2-2. Store as a shared boolean array.

  2-3. In the same kernel, for every raster point (thread and a shared array of N) and the test atoms, test the distance if the boolean is true. 

  2-4. Calculate volume of SASA for this atom. 


2.  Make a S_ref and dS calculator using speedtest.cu as template.
