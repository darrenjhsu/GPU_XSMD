This project is to use GPU to accelerate X-ray scattering calculation with Debye formula looping over atoms and use it in MD simulation. Concepts were taken from Bjorling et al. JCTC 2015, 11, 780. 

The calculation of scattering profile is the same as in FoXS but the form factors are calculated explicitly. The c1 and c2 terms used for fitting in FoXS are no longer fitting variables; they are now parameters.

The atomic form factors in vacuum are calculated using Waasmaier-Kirfel table. The volume for dummy atom calcualtion were taken from Svergun 1995 J Appl Crystallgr paper, which refers to Fraser 1978 J Appl Crystallgr paper and International Tables for X-ray Crystallography (1968). 

In the surface area calculation part the generating function is from Guidance Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit 1998 Bauer. 

The surface area calculation is done numerically following J Appl Crystallgr 1983 Connolly "Analytical Molecular Surface Calculation." Rasterized points sample the vdW sphere, which has to be outside of any other vdW spheres of other atoms. Extended by solvent radius the point (solvent center) must also be far enough from the vdW spheres of other atoms.

The software has been tested and compared with FoXS and CRYSOL, resulting in similar parameters. A c2 = 2.78 here corresponds to c2 = 2.86 in FoXS fitting and contrast of 0.030 e / A^3 in CRYSOL. Difference here may be a result of different surface area calc implementations. 


Of the files, 

Init_calc.cu       calculates with given two sets of coordinates, the scattering pattern for reference (S_ref) and for initial (S_init) structures, and then compute the difference (dS = S_ref - S_init)

raster.cu          specifies parameters. 
kernel.cu          is the workhorse of the package.
XSMD.cu            is where the code NAMD calls every step is in.
speedtest.cu       is to test new features.
